def lcsi(X, y, n_selected_features=None, beta=None, gamma=None, function_name=None, **kwargs):
    """
    This function implements the basic scoring criteria for linear combination of shannon information term.
    The scoring criteria is calculated based on the formula j_cmi=I(f;y)-beta*sum_j(I(fj;f))+gamma*sum(I(fj;f|y))

    Input
    -----
    X: {numpy array}, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        input data, guaranteed to be a discrete data matrix
    y: {numpy array}, shape (n_samples,)
        input class labels
    kwargs: {dictionary}
        Parameters for different feature selection algorithms.
        beta: {float}
            beta is the parameter in j_cmi=I(f;y)-beta*sum(I(fj;f))+gamma*sum(I(fj;f|y))
        gamma: {float}
            gamma is the parameter in j_cmi=I(f;y)-beta*sum(I(fj;f))+gamma*sum(I(fj;f|y))
        function_name: {string}
            name of the feature selection function
        n_selected_features: {int}
            number of features to select

    Output
    ------
    F: {numpy array}, shape: (n_features,)
        index of selected features, F[0] is the most important feature
